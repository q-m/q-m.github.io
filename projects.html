<p>With a small <a href="http://www.thequestionmark.org/over/team#development">development team</a> we tackle
challenges from data mining and score computation to visualization and user experience. But there are more
things we'd love to do, than we can do. Some of those are listed here.</p>


<p>If you're a student looking for a meaningful internship on one of these topics, feel free to
<a href="http://www.thequestionmark.org/contact">contact us</a>. Or perhaps you recognize some of these
challenges and would like to explore collaboration, likewise. Perhaps we can join forces.</p>
