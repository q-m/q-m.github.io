The [Questionmark API](/api-docs/) exposes a portion of our food product database. Now and then
somebody approaches us who wants to use it for research, build a prototype, or integrate
it into their own systems (like [Telesuper](https://www.telesuper.nl/info/gezondheidsscore-en-questionmark.html)).

This year, [Cell-0](https://cell-0.com/) approached us if they could use the Questionmark API
for a (non-commercial) prototype. It's fun to see what others can come up with, and cool to see that
a browser can scan barcodes, nowadays, for example with [QuaggaJS](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/).
Even though performance is not always on par with native apps, this is likely to improve with
future developments (like the [shape detection API](https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/#barcode-detection-api) draft).
