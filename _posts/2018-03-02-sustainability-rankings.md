[Questionmark](http://www.thequestionmark.org/) provides a ranking on health and sustainability for supermarket
products. Until now, we've been giving products a [health rating](http://www.thequestionmark.org/methode/gezondheid)
in five steps and a [sustainability score](http://www.thequestionmark.org/methode) from 1-10.
This is derived from [life cycle assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment),
[social product assessment](https://product-social-impact-assessment.com/) and an animal methodology based on
ingredients, origin, packaging, etc.

Now and then, we take a fresh look at how our ranking influences society. Then it's helpful to look at other
initiatives that provide rankings on sustainability topics, to find inspiration, get ideas, and see where we
fit in. The following summary includes world-wide and country-level indicators, as well as (food) brand ratings
up to information on very specific categories (like meat and fish).
